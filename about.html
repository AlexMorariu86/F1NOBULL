      <h1>About F1 - No RedBull</h1>
      <p>Formula 1, once a sport where titans dueled wheel-to-wheel, has entered an era of predictable dominance. 
         Red Bull's relentless victories have cast a shadow, leaving fans yearning for the bygone days of nail-biting competition.
         Fueled by this disillusionment, F1-NoRedBull emerges not just as a web application for race statistics,
        but as a rebellion against the current state of F1.</p>
      <p>F1-NoRedBull makes a bold statement by deliberately excluding the reigning champions. 
        This compels fans to refocus on the underdogs - the midfield teams locked in intense battles for position. Here, 
        the roar of the crowd isn't for the inevitable victor, but for the daring overtake, the strategic masterclass, 
        or the unexpected challenger emerging from the pack. In this curated reality, 
        the true magic of Formula 1 - the relentless pursuit of victory - takes center stage.</p>
